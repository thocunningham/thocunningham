# Hi, I'm Thomas 👋

I am an 18-year-old Computer Science student at LIACS (Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science) in the Netherlands.

### 👨‍💻 About Me
* I'm a first-year CS student, and I'm passionate about low-level computing: CPU architectures and design, operating systems, and fundamental systems that run the world.
* My programming experience started back when I was about 14-15 years old. And therefore, nearly all of my knowledge is self-taught out of interest.

### 🔧 Languages & Tools
* **C/C++**: Together with the [Compiler Explorer](godbolt.org), taught me most of what I know about assembly (mainly x86 and RISC-V) and low-level concepts such as operating systems, memory management, and more.
* **Go**: My current go-to for everyday development, which I am using for my ongoing personal projects.
* **Python**: My tool of choice for writing scripts and quick automation.
* **Zig**: Having only recently started "working" with Zig, I am still learning the language.

### 🚀 What I'm working on
* [**Cobalt**](github.com/thocunningham/cobalt): My own hobby programming language where everything is treated as a value.
  With this project, I have learned and will still learn a lot about compiler architecture and language design.
* [**RED**](github.com/thocunningham/red): A lightweight and high-speed RISC-V encoder library written in Go.
